Particular attention is given to (A + UBV)-1, where A is nonsingular and U, B and V may be rectangular; generalized inverses of A + UBV are also considered. Several statistical applications are discussed.},

 ISSN = {08834237, 21688745},
 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2245395},
 abstract = {Piecewise polynomials or splines extend the advantages of polynomials to include greater flexibility, local effects of parameter changes and the possibility of imposing useful constraints on estimated functions. Among these constraints is monotonicity, which can be an important property in many curve estimation problems. This paper shows the virtues of monotone splines through a number of statistical applications, including response variable transformation in nonlinear regression, transformation of variables in multiple regression, principal components and canonical correlation, and the use of monotone splines to model a dose-response function and to perform item analysis. Computational and inferential issues are discussed and illustrated.},

% Unit interval density estimation from Gaussian copula (they show that not different from cheng and define a default choice for bandwith instead of scott)
@article{Kernel-Type-Density-Estimation-on-the-Unit-Interval,
 ISSN = {00063444, 14643510},
 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/20441430},
 abstract = {We consider kernel-type methods for the estimation of a density on [0, 1] which eschew explicit boundary correction. We propose using kernels that are symmetric in their two arguments; these kernels are conditional densities of bivariate copulas. We give asymptotic theory for the version of the new estimator using Gaussian copula kernels and report on simulation comparisons of it with the beta-kernel density estimator of Chen (1999). We also provide automatic bandwidth selection in the form of 'rule-of-thumb' bandwidths for both estimators. As well as its competitive integrated squared error performance, advantages of the new approach include its greater range of possible values at 0 and 1, the fact that it is a bona fide density and that the individual kernels and resulting estimator are comprehensible in terms of a single simple picture.},
